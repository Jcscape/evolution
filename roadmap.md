Milestones
M1: Core engine refactor into package `evo/`, tests, CSV logging, config.
M2: Rich genetics: multi-gene genome, crossover, mutation strategies, heritable behaviors.
M3: Metabolism and resources: energy, entropy, heat, multi-resource economy, waste.
M4: Senses and cognition: vision, gradient sensing, memory, simple RL-like value updates.
M5: Physics on a toroidal 2D space + sparse obstacles; later N-D generalization.
M6: Ecology: niches, trophic levels, predator-prey, symbiosis, parasitism.
M7: Procedural “wild space” fields: noise-based resource flows, cosmic events, radiation.
M8: Reproduction strategies: sexual, asexual, budding, spore-like dispersal.
M9: Social behaviors: signaling, coalition formation, game-theory payoffs.
M10: Data: metrics, checkpoints, replay, deterministic seeds, profiling, docs.
